Place the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (make sure the bowl doesn't touch the water) and stir for 5 minutes or until melted. Use an electric beater to whisk together the sugar and eggs in a large bowl until light and creamy. Add the cream cheese and beat until well combined. Use a metal spoon to fold in the chocolate, cocoa powder and vanilla until just combined. Add the sour cream and stir to combine. Pour the mixture into the biscuit base and smooth the surface. Bake for 1 hour or until just set in the centre. Turn oven off. Leave cake in oven, with door ajar, for 2 hours or until cooled completely (this will prevent the cake from cracking).

Meanwhile, using an electric mixer, beat cream cheese, yoghurt and sugar on low speed until smooth, then beat in gelatine mixture until combined, scraping down the side of the bowl occasionally. In a clean bowl, whisk remaining 250ml (1 cup) cream to soft peaks, then fold into cream cheese mixture until just combined. Gently fold in half the Turkish delight. Divide mixture among the moulds, then refrigerate for 4 hours or until set. Preheat oven to 180C. To make rhubarb, toss rhubarb with sugar in a small ovenproof dish, then drizzle over orange juice. Cover dish with foil, then bake for 30 minutes or until rhubarb is soft but still holds its shape. Cool, then refrigerate until needed. To serve, briefly dip moulds in a bowl of hot water, then run a knife around the inside of each mould to release cakes. Carefully invert onto plates or into cups. Top with remaining Turkish delight.
